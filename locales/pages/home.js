I like clean, organized and minimalistic places and workspaces. I'm a creative introvert and see myself as very honest, trustworthy and thoughtful. I'm the opposite of impulsive with my decisions, everything I do has a purpose or needed a lot of thought. I'm an analyst and a problem solver who likes to learn new skills if I see benefit in the skill in question.",

I develop new ideas for our website and help to further improve and expand the website's code base, functionality and usability. I love to be creative in this area, make up design patterns and adapt to new trends when they emerge. Despite my neophobia I really adore to experiment with other creative work like video production, animations, illustrations, interior design or even writing for books. In fact in a perfect future I want to have written and published a book, illustrated books for children, though I'm not pursuing these dreams actively.",
