Meine Freunde und Familie würden mich als jemanden beschreiben, der einem Perfektionist nahe kommt. Ordentlich, organisiert, minimalistisch. Ich selber sehe mich als eine kreative und introvertierte Seele, die offen und optimistisch der Zukunft entgegenblickt. Ich bin ein begeisterter Problemlöser, der gerne neue Fähigkeiten erlernt, egal ob sie dafür benötigt werden oder nicht.",

Despite my neophobia I really adore to experiment with other creative work like video production, animations, illustrations, interior design or even writing for books. In fact in a perfect future I want to have written and published a book, illustrated books for children, though I'm not pursuing these dreams actively.",

I like clean, organized and minimalistic places and workspaces. I'm a creative introvert and see myself as very honest, trustworthy and thoughtful. I'm the opposite of impulsive with my decisions, everything I do has a purpose or needed a lot of thought. I'm an analyst and a problem solver who likes to learn new skills if I see benefit in the skill in question.",
